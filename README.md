# Analysis of Pewlett Hackard Retiring Employees and Mentors
The purpose of this analysis was to determine retiring employees by title, so Hewlett-Packard would know specifically who might be retiring soon as well as, what positions need to be filled within the next few years. Of the remaining employees we also wanted to know who would be eligible for a new mentorship program at the company.

## Results


### Retirement Analysis
-	The least number of employees leaving have the title Manager
-	The greatest number of employees leaving have the title Senior Engineer
-	43,636 team members with the title engineer are retirement eligible

### Mentor Analysis
-	Total number of employees eligible to become mentors = 1550
-	No managers are eligible to be mentors
-	748 have the title engineer

## Summary


### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Over 90,000 roles will need to be filled, almost half of them are engineers. Pewlett Hackard should consider looking into hiring engineers prior to these employees retiring so the knowledge can be transferred to the new workforce or potentially incentivize employees to stay on a little longer so the new workers can be trained.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Out of over 400,000 employees only 1,550 are eligible to be mentors. I would consider expanding the pool to be not by age but consider their years of service or their title. Several other factors can make employees great mentors that cannot be quantified in a table. We also need to consider the willingness of employees to participate in the program.
